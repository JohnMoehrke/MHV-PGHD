### Search PGHD

BodyWeight are recorded by various applications using the same LOINC codes, MHV will query PGHD asking for Observations with that code. 

The following is a example, hitting the test PGHD service, about a test patient. 
```
https://veteran.apps-staging.va.gov/smart-pgd-fhir/v2/Observation?patient.identifier=urn:uuid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.349|1012853550V207686&code=http://loinc.org|29463-7&_sort=-date&_count=100&_pretty=true&_format=json 
```
Breakdown of query parameters
- patient.identifier -- this takes the patient ICN, and the server will find appropriate entries for that patient
- code - searching for Observations with the codes
  - [LOINC 29463-7](https://loinc.org/29463-7/) - Body weight
- _sort -- ask that the results be sorted by date
- _count -- ask that no more than 100 be returned in each page
- _pretty -- ask that the results be pretty printed (normal json has no unnecessary whitespace)
- _format -- ask for json encoding

Results will be limited to 100 BodyWeight Observations.

The next page is retrieved using the FHIR [paging](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#paging) mechanism.

The User Experience should NOT be aware of pages at the FHIR API level.
