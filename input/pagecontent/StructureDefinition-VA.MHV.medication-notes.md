This is the notes for the VA.MHV.medication Profile


### Positive Tests

TODO write this in cucumber.

load all of the medication examples that are [compliant to the MHV profile](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.medication-examples.html) into PGHD, 
* show them in MHV, they should show fine. 

load all of the other medication examples. Some data won't show at all. They should not crash MHV.
* edit them in MHV, they should show the data that MHV understands. When the edit is saved, the resulting resource in PGHD should now be conformant to the [MHV medication profile](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.medication.html)

### Negative Tests

TODO write this in cucumber.
