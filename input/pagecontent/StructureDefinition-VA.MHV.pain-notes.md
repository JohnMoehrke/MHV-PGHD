This is the notes for the VA.MHV.pain Profile


### Positive Tests

TODO write this in cucumber.

load all of the pain examples that are [compliant to the MHV profile](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.pain-examples.html) into PGHD, 
* show them in MHV, they should show fine. 

load all of the other pain examples. Some data won't show at all. They should not crash MHV.
* edit them in MHV, they should show the data that MHV understands. When the edit is saved, the resulting resource in PGHD should now be conformant to the [MHV pain profile](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.pain.html)

### Negative Tests

TODO write this in cucumber.
