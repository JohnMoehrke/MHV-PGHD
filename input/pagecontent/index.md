Implementation Guide defining structureDefinition profiles, examples, and testing for how MyHealtheVet publishes to PGHD.

The main sections of this IG are:

- [Background](background.html)
- [Artifacts](artifacts.html)
- [TestPlan](testplan.html)
- [Downloads](downloads.html)

Most of the MHV profiles are based on [HL7 FHIR US-Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/index.html) implementation guide, which provides guidance to the USA marketplace that VHA participates within.  Deeper explaination is provided in the US-Core specification.
